## About
This repo is for the Udacity Front End Web Development course I am taking to improve my programming skills.

Any constructive criticism is welcome!

## Instructions
The objective of this game is to match all 16 tiles as quickly and as accurately as possible. 

You are given 10 lives total (in the form of stars), and you lose a life for each unsuccessful match. 

When you flip 2 cards, the game will check if they matched. If they don't, you will have a brief moment to look at the 2 cards before tehy are flipped back over and you must try again. If they do match, they will remain flipped over and you must match the remaining set of unflipped cards.

Whether you win, lose, or want to restart, you'll have the opportunity to do so mid-game with the reset button, or at the end of the game.

You can play the game online at https://alex-stork.github.io/Memory-Game/, or you can download the entire ZIP file and open in your local browser.
