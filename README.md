## About
This repo is for the Udacity Front End Web Development course I am taking to improve my programming skills.

Any constructive criticism is welcome!

## Prerequisites / Dependencies
To use this program locally, you must have the following:
1) An Internet browser
2) If you want to run the game locally, you must install and extract the entire ZIP folder, as it requires the HTML, JavaScript, CSS files, as well as the image for the background, otherwise you can play the game online at https://alex-stork.github.io/Memory-Game/. To install locally, simply right click on "Clone or download" and select Download ZIP, then open the HTML file via your Internet browser.

## Game Rules / Instructions
The objective of this game is to match all 16 tiles as quickly and as accurately as possible. 

You are given 10 stars to start out with, and every unsuccessful match will result in losing 1 star. The best rating is 10 stars, the worst rating is 1 star. 

When you flip 2 cards, the game will check if they matched. If they don't, you will have a brief moment to look at the 2 cards before tehy are flipped back over and you must try again. If they do match, they will remain flipped over and you must match the remaining set of unflipped cards.

Whether you win, lose, or want to restart, you'll have the opportunity to do so mid-game with the reset button, or at the end of the game.
